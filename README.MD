## Overview

KROD (Knowledge-Reinforced Operational Developer) is a specialized AI research assistant designed to help researchers, engineers, and scientists solve complex problems across coding, mathematics, and scientific domains. Unlike general-purpose AI assistants, KROD focuses on depth rather than breadth, providing advanced capabilities for research and development.

KROD is created to enhance and empower research based on coding, development, and mathematics. Unlike other models available, KROD aims to excel in the research domain, expanding to unprecedented outcomes and unreachable research and development. KROD is an excellent choice for coding or workflows, learning and adapting to unlimited possibilities, helping researchers in a valuable way.

KROD is not built for regular tasks; rather, it is created to help researchers and software engineers uncover breakthroughs—simplifying complex problems and paving the way for more efficient, intelligent solutions.

- Flexible integration of new domains and capabilities
- Cross-domain reasoning through the knowledge graph
- Extensibility through community contributions

## Usage

KROD can be used through multiple interfaces, each designed for different use cases.

### Command Line Interface

The CLI provides direct access to KROD's capabilities:

```bash
# Start interactive KROD session
krod

# Process a specific query
krod query "Analyze the time complexity of quicksort and suggest optimizations for nearly-sorted data"

# Start a research session with a specific focus
krod session --topic "Efficient graph algorithms for social network analysis"

# Export research findings
krod export --session <session_id> --format markdown
```

### Python API

Integrate KROD into your Python applications:

```python
from krod import KrodEngine

# Initialize the engine with custom configuration
krod = KrodEngine(config={
    "modules": ["code", "math", "research"],
    "llm": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "gpt-4"
    }
})

# Process a research query
result = krod.process(
    "Design an experiment to test the efficiency of different sorting algorithms on partially sorted data"
)

# Access the response
print(result["response"])

# Work with a research session
session = krod.create_session(topic="Algorithm optimization")
session.add_query("What are the best approaches for optimizing quicksort?")
session.add_artifact("code", "def quicksort(arr): ...")
findings = session.generate_summary()
```

### Web Interface (Coming Soon)

A web interface for interacting with KROD will be available in a future release, providing:

- Interactive research sessions
- Visualization of knowledge connections
- Collaborative research capabilities
- Integration with development environments

### Integration Examples

KROD can be integrated with various tools and workflows:
